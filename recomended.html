        <p>An amazing destination in Europe is the micro-state of Liechtenstein. One reason this tiny country is so unconventional is the fact that it’s doubly land-locked by Austria and Switzerland. It’s also a mere 25 kilometres long.</p>
        <p>In Liechtenstein you’ll also discover beautiful natural wonders. Hiking is one of the most popular activities and Eschnerberg Trail is one of the most-hiked trails in the entire region. The views of the Alpine Rhine and mountains are reason enough to visit Liechtenstein.</p>

        <p>Lithuania is a little-known country in Eastern Europe filled with castles and forests, shore line and old-town charm.</p>
        <p>Thirty percent of the country is covered with forest and nature. Between the unspoiled wilderness and the charm of the historical cities, there is truly something for everyone in unexpected Lithuania!</p>

        <p>Home to a historic city centre, a thriving arts scene and vast countryside dotted with castles.</p>
        <p>Outside the capital, visitors to Latvia can tour the country’s many medieval castles and fortifications. Those looking to spend some time outdoors can head to Latvia’s beaches along the Baltic coast, or to one of the country’s many national parks.</p>
